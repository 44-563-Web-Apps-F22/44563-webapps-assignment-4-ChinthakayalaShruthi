      Go and do your best endeavour,
    And before all links we sever,
    We will say farewell for-ever.
    Go to glory and the grave!</p>

    <p class="speech">
      For your foes are fierce and ruthless,
      False, unmerciful, and truthless;
      Young and tender, old and toothless,
      All in vain their mercy crave.</p>
      <h6 class="ser">SER:</h6>
      <p class="speech">
       We observe too great a stress,
    On the risks that on us press,
    And of reference a lack
    To our chance of coming back.
    Still, perhaps it would be wise
    Not to carp or criticise,
    For it's very evident
    These attentions are well meant.</p>
    <h6 class="pol">POL:</h6>
    <p class="speech">
      Yes, it's very evident
    These attentions are well meant,
    Evident, yes, well meant, evident
    Ah, yes, well meant!
