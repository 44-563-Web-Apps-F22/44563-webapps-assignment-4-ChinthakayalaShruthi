        <h4>Scene.-A ruined chapel by moonlight.  Aisles C., R. and L.,
            divided by pillars and arches, ruined Gothic windows at

            Oh, Frederic, cannot you, in the calm excellence of
            your wisdom, reconcile it with your conscience to say
            something that will relieve my father's sorrow? </p>

            I will try, dear Mabel.  But why does he sit, night
            after night, in this draughty old ruin? </p>
        <h6 class="gen">GEN:</h6>   
        <p class="speech">
            Why do I sit here?  To escape from the pirates'
            clutches, I described myself as an orphan; and, heaven
            help me, I am no orphan!  I come here to humble myself
            before the tombs of my ancestors, and to implore their
            pardon for having brought dishonour on the family
            escutcheon. </p>
        <h6 class="gen">FRE:</h6>  
        <p class="speech">     
            Be comforted.  Had you not acted as you did, these
            reckless men would assuredly have called in the nearest
            clergyman, and have married your large family on the
            spot. </p>
        <h6 class="gen">GEN:</h6>   
        <p class="speech"> 
            I thank you for your proffered solace, but it is
            unavailing.  I assure you, Frederic, that such is the
            anguish and remorse I feel at the abominable falsehood
            by which I escaped these easily deluded pirates, that I
            would go to their simple-minded chief this very night
            and confess all, did I not fear that the consequences
            would be most disastrous to myself.  At what time does
            your expedition march against these scoundrels?</p>

            At eleven, and before midnight I hope to have atoned
            for my involuntary association with the pestilent
            scourges by sweeping them from the face of the earthâ€”
            and then, dear Mabel, you will be mine!</p>

         Is to slap our chests and sing,
         Tarantara!
         For when threatened with -meutes,

         And your heart is in your boots,

          Go to death, and go to slaughter;
          Die, and every Cornish daughter
